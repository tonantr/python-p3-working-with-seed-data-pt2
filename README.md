# Working with Seed Data Part 2

## Learning Goals

- Use seed data to populate a database containing one-to-many and many-to-many
  relationships...

***

## Key Vocab

- **Schema**: the blueprint of a database. Describes how data relates to other
  data in tables, columns, and relationships between them.
- **Persist**: save a schema in a database.
- **Engine**: a Python object that translates SQL to Python and vice-versa.
- **Session**: a Python object that uses an engine to allow us to
  programmatically interact with a database.
- **Transaction**: a strategy for executing database statements such that
  the group succeeds or fails as a unit.
- **Migration**: the process of moving data from one or more databases to one
  or more target databases.
- **Seed**: to fill a database with an initial set of data.

## Introduction

What good is a database without any data? In the previous module, we learned
how to create fake data using Faker and the SQLAlchemy ORM in Python scripts.
Remember that we refer to the process of adding sample data to the database as
**"seeding"** the database. In the previous lesson on seeding, we focused on
simple, unrelated data. In this lesson, we will focus on populating databases
with one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

This lesson is set up as a code-along, so make sure to fork and clone the
lesson. Then run these commands to set up the dependencies and set up the
database:

```console
$ pipenv install; pipenv shell

# => Installing dependencies from Pipfile.lock (xxxxxx)...

# =>  . /python-p3-working-with-seed-data-pt2/.venv/bin/activate
# => $  . /python-p3-working-with-seed-data-pt2/.venv/bin/activate

$ cd lib
$ alembic upgrade head
```

In this application, we have two migrations: one for our declarative `Base`,
and a second for three tables: `games`, `reviews`, and `users`. Due to the
added complexity of the relationships, we're keeping these tables as simple as
possible- this means we won't be using Faker, but it's available to you in your
pipenv if you want to build out your database a bit more on your own.

```py
# models.py

class Game(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'games'

    id = Column(Integer(), primary_key=True)

    reviews = relationship('Review', backref='game')
    users = association_proxy('reviews', 'user',
        creator=lambda us: Review(user=us))

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Game(id={self.id})'

class Review(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'reviews'

    id = Column(Integer(), primary_key=True)

    game_id = Column(Integer(), ForeignKey('games.id'))
    user_id = Column(Integer(), ForeignKey('users.id'))

    def __repr__(self):
       return f'Review(id={self.id})'

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'

    id = Column(Integer(), primary_key=True)

    reviews = relationship('Review', backref='user')
    games = association_proxy('reviews', 'game',
        creator=lambda gm: Review(game=gm))

    def __repr__(self):
       return f'User(id={self.id})'

```

Run `alembic upgrade head` from the `lib/` directory to create your database.

## Creating Our Records

We're going to start off our seed file just as we did in the last module:
by creating records. To keep our code organized, let's break the functionality
into separate functions:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from random import choice as rc

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

from models import Game, Review, User

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///seed_db.db')
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

def create_games():
    games = [Game() for i in range(100)]
    session.add_all(games)
    session.commit()
    return games

def create_reviews():
    reviews = [Review() for i in range(1000)]
    session.add_all(reviews)
    session.commit()
    return reviews

def create_users():
    users = [User() for i in range(500)]
    session.add_all(users)
    session.commit()
    return users

if __name__ == '__main__':
    games = create_games()
    reviews = create_reviews()
    users = create_users()

```

Here, we create a session object and use it to generate different numbers of
records. It's usually a good idea to keep this realistic - there will probably
be more reviews than users and more users than games. With that in mind, we
created 1000, 500, and 100, respectively.

Each set of creations is broken into a separate function here. These are very
simple functions and could be refactored into a single function if desired,
but this may negatively impact readability and scalability. The choice is
ultimately yours!

```py

...

def create_records():
    games = [Game() for i in range(100)]
    reviews = [Review() for i in range(1000)]
    users = [User() for i in range(500)]
    session.add_all(games + reviews + users)
    session.commit()
    return games, reviews, users

if __name__ == '__main__':
    games, reviews, users = create_records()

```

Run `python seed.py` and navigate to `seed_db.db`. You should see records in all
three tables!

### Clearing the Database

Let's make one last change before we continue. When we seed a database, we want
the database to contain new data _and only new data_. This means that we need to
delete all records before we begin seeding.

```py

...

def delete_records():
    session.query(Game).delete()
    session.query(Review).delete()
    session.query(User).delete()
    session.commit()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    delete_records()
    games, reviews, users = create_records()

```

***

## Building Relationships

In the models provided, there are two one-to-many relationships (games and
reviews, users and reviews) and one many-to-many relationship (games and users).
Building out one-to-many relationships is simple: just add one to the other.
Remember that the "one" will contain a `list` attribute of the many, where the
"many" will simply contain a reference to the "one" object.

### One-to-Many

We can use the `random.choice()` method (aliased as `rc`) to assign users and
games to reviews:

```py

...

def relate_one_to_many(games, reviews, users):
    for review in reviews:
        review.user = rc(users)
        review.game = rc(games)
    
    session.add_all(reviews)
    session.commit()
    return games, reviews, users

if __name__ == '__main__':
    delete_records()
    games, reviews, users = create_records()
    games, reviews, users = relate_one_to_many(games, reviews, users)

```

Run `python seed.py` and reopen `seed_db.db` (you may need to close it first),
and you should see that the `reviews` table now has `user_id`s and `game_id`s
associated with each review!

### Many-to-Many

We've just added one game and one user to each review. There are likely some
users without reviews and possibly some games without reviews as well. This
reflects real life, so we don't need to worry about it! Keep this in mind when
writing your own seed files to make sure that any connections that need to exist
(like a review to both a user and a game) are made.

At this point, we just need to build the relationships between games and users.
Since we used an association proxy inside of an association object model, we
don't actually need to do anything!

Run `python debug.py` to explore:

```console
ipdb> game = session.query(Game).first()
ipdb> game.reviews
=> [Review(id=410), Review(id=533), Review(id=594), Review(id=601), Review(id=695), Review(id=991)]
ipdb> game.users
=> [User(id=380), User(id=406), User(id=113), User(id=203), User(id=355), User(id=391)]
```

As expected, each game has a `reviews` attribute that contains a list of
review records. Each game _also_ has a `users` attribute that contains a list
of user records! The association proxy in our association object model triggered
the population of this attribute as connections were made from reviews toward
users and games. This worked for the `users` table as well:

```console
ipdb> user = session.query(User).all()[2]
ipdb> user.reviews
=> [Review(id=3), Review(id=855)]
ipdb> user.games
=> [Game(id=46), Game(id=18)]
```

Note that we needed to get the third user record here because the first two had
no reviews. This reflects what we would expect to see in real data, but it's
also something tricky to plan for in debugging.

<details>
  <summary>
    <em>How can we ensure that we find user records with reviews?</em>
  </summary>

  <h3><code>users = session.query(User).filter(User.reviews)</code></h3>
  <p>A mouthful, sure.</p>
  <p>Remember that <code>filter()</code> evaluates logical statements- here,
     we're looking for all users with reviews.</p>
</details>
<br/>

You are never _required_ to use an association object model or any specific
strategy for many-to-many relationships. Just know that you'll need a bit of
custom code to populate those relationships if you don't use an association
proxy.

***

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned how to build a seed script for more complex data.
You should now be able to build a database with relationships and populate it
with realistic data.

If you're still working some things out, don't worry! Your instructors and
coaches are available to help you figure out any lingering uncertainties from
this difficult module. You'll see some practice labs coming up to help prepare
you for the Phase 3 Code Challenge.

## Solution Code

_The solution code below has been modified to reflect the final functionality
of the seed file. Certain segments have been moved or renamed._

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from random import choice as rc

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

from models import Game, Review, User

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///seed_db.db')
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

def delete_records():
    session.query(Game).delete()
    session.query(Review).delete()
    session.query(User).delete()
    session.commit()

def create_records():
    games = [Game() for i in range(100)]
    reviews = [Review() for i in range(1000)]
    users = [User() for i in range(500)]
    session.add_all(games + reviews + users)
    session.commit()
    return games, reviews, users

def relate_records(games, reviews, users):
    for review in reviews:
        review.user = rc(users)
        review.game = rc(games)
    
    session.add_all(reviews)
    session.commit()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    delete_records()
    games, reviews, users = create_records()
    relate_records(games, reviews, users)

```
